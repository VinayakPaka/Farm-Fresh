Steps to fix the caching issue:

1. Stop your development server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)

2. Clear Metro bundler cache by running ONE of these commands:
   - npx expo start -c
   OR
   - npx expo start --clear

3. If that doesn't work, do a full reset:
   - Delete the .expo folder (if it exists)
   - Run: npx expo start -c

4. Make sure to reload the app on your device/emulator:
   - Press 'r' in the terminal
   OR
   - Shake the device and select "Reload"
   OR
   - Press Ctrl+M (Android) or Cmd+D (iOS) and select "Reload"

The error happens because the old bundled JavaScript is still cached and doesn't have the updated props.
